		<h3 id="ACCESSIBILITY" class="rrHelp jumptarget-breadcrumbs"> Universal Design</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><span class="redtext italicstext">v</span>HMML was envisioned, designed and created with principles of Universal Design in mind for all users, including those with different abilities. Accessibility for users who might utilize different input devices 
		or assistive technology was considered from the very beginning. Part of the goal was to try to make the interface more flexible to be accessible for all kinds of users, especially for <a href="${pageContext.request.contextPath}/readingRoom">Reading Room</a> and <a href="${pageContext.request.contextPath}/folio">Folio</a>.</li> 
		<li>We provided point of need context-sensitive Help on all modules, with <a href="${pageContext.request.contextPath}/contact">contact email</a> available from any page from a contact link in the footer. </li> 
		<li><a href="http://www.hmml.org/" target="_blank">HMML</a> realizes that accessibility and Universal Design are goals 
		in which we can continue to improve. Please <a href="${pageContext.request.contextPath}/contact">contact us</a> if you have issues accessing our <span class="redtext italicstext">v</span>HMML site or if you have ideas for how we might continue to improve our design so that all may participate in using our 
		resources and tools for manuscript studies.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3 class="rrHelp">Known issues</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><span class="redtext italicstext">v</span>HMML hasn't
				been optimized for smaller devices such as iPhones or Android
				phones.
			</li>
			<li>Older Mac OS X systems may appear to run, but specific features such as search and feedback corrections or additions may be inoperable.</li>
			<li>Because of the high-resolution of the images used in <span
				class="redtext italicstext">v</span>HMML, users with slow internet
			connections may experience a delay in image loading.</li>
			<li> If your browser scrolling freezes while using the image zoom on a tablet or other mobile device, just refresh the page to engage the scrolling again.</li>
			<li>If you are <a href="${pageContext.request.contextPath}/login">signed in</a> to <span class="redtext italicstext">v</span>HMML and are not active on any of the pages for
 ${pageContext.session.maxInactiveInterval / 60  } minutes, the system will inquire whether you still want to remain signed in. If you still do not respond, the system will automatically sign you out to maintain security.</li>
						<li>The system does not currently save a record of your previous searches when you sign out or if you do not interact with the system for more than  ${pageContext.session.maxInactiveInterval / 60  } minutes. The next time you <a href="${pageContext.request.contextPath}/login">sign in</a>, you will need to re-create any previous searches. </li>
						<li>The use of ad-blockers can hinder the viewing of images. Please disable any ad-blocker browser plug-ins to insure full functionality.</li>

		<h3>A special note about Syriac</h3>
			If you see a series of small boxes where you expect to see Syriac characters, here are suggestions for various platforms:
 			<ul>
 				<li>iOS devices: iPads or other iOS devices will not display
				Syriac fonts until you install a third-party application. You might
				consider this free app or ones like it that will render Syriac
				Unicode: <a
				href="https://www.apptopia.com/apps/itunes_connect/980346488/about"
				target="_blank">https://www.apptopia.com/apps/itunes_connect/980346488/about</a>
				</li>
				<li> Mac OS X computers: if Syriac fonts need to be installed, we
				recommend following these directions: <a
				href="http://www.bethmardutho.org/index.php/syriac-mac.html"
				target="_blank">http://www.bethmardutho.org/index.php/syriac-mac.html</a>
				</li>
				<li>On a Windows PC: one solution is to  
				<a href="http://www.bethmardutho.org/index.php/resources/fonts.html" target="_blank">download the free Meltho Fonts.</a>
				After unzipping the melthofonts-xxx.zip file, open the folder where the fonts were unzipped, select all of the .OTF files, right-click and then click Install.
				If the fonts were installed correctly, instead of the above rectangles you should now see Syriac characters.<br />
				<br />
				Microsoft Internet Explorer 11 and Edge browsers do not render Syriac plurals correctly. If users wish to view Syriac records with 
				native script, we recommend utilizing a different browser other than IE 11 or Microsoft Edge.
				</li>
