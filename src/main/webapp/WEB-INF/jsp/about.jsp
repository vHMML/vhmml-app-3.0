			<span class="redtext italicstext">v</span>HMML offers resources and tools 
			for the study of manuscripts and currently features manuscript cultures from 
			Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia. The site houses high-resolution 
			images of manuscripts, many of them digitized as part of <a href="http://www.hmml.org/" target="_blank">HMML</a>&#8217;s global mission to 
			preserve and share important, endangered, and inaccessible manuscript collections 
			through digital photography, archiving, and cataloging. It also contains descriptions 
			of manuscripts from HMML's legacy microfilm collection, with scans of some of these films.

			<h3 id="HISTORY" class="subheading jumptarget">History</h3>
			<span class="redtext italicstext">v</span>HMML is an initiative of the <a href="http://www.hmml.org/" target="_blank">Hill Museum
				<span class="redtext">&amp;</span> Manuscript Library</a>. 
			The project began as a partnership between HMML staff and developers from the Center for Digital Humanities 
			at Saint Louis University (James Ginther, <abbr title="principal investigator">PI</abbr>) and the Carolingian Canon Law Project at the University of 
			Kentucky (Abigail Firey, <abbr title="principal investigator">PI</abbr>), with initial support from a 2012 National Leadership Grant by the Institute of 
			Museum and Library Services, supplemented by the Arcadia Fund.
			
			<p>
				<span class="redtext italicstext">v</span>HMML 1.0, with School, Lexicon, Reference and Folio, 
				launched in October 2015. The 
				first three components were developed by Chad LaVigne of <a
					href="https://www.solutiondesign.com/" target="_blank">Solution
					Design Group (sdg)</a> in Golden Valley, Minnesota. The team at the University of Kentucky developed Folio 
				using the rich tools of Scriptorium, the digital environment they designed for collaborative research on manuscripts.
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="redtext italicstext">v</span>HMML 2.0 with Reading Room launched in August 2016. Even 
				before the launch of <span class="redtext italicstext">v</span>HMML 1.0, the HMML team was working 
				on a virtual Reading Room that would be the centerpiece of <span class="redtext italicstext">v</span>HMML 2.0. 
				The task required a comprehensive makeover of OLIVER, HMML's online manuscript catalog first developed in the 
				late 1990s. The choice of Mirador, a IIIF-compliant image viewer, and the creation of a new metadata schema to 
				replace OLIVER, put Reading Room at the forefront of developments in manuscript description for digital 
				environments. Reading Room was funded by the Henry Luce Foundation. The new catalog database that replaced 
				OLIVER was funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. Improvements to <span class="redtext italicstext">v</span>HMML 
				2.0 were released in the spring of 2018 as the initial results of a Digital Humanities Advancement Grant 
				from the National Endowment for the Humanities.
			</p>
			<p><span class="redtext italicstext">v</span>HMML 3.0, a complete reworking of the project with added data-sharing 
			features, was launched in a series of releases between April and September 2018. The new design is optimized for 
			simpler navigation and easier access to search options. Content across the site, including metadata in Reading Room, 
			is now discoverable in web searches as a result of Search Engine Optimization. The new Data Portal and associated 
			<a href="https://www.vhmmldh.org/" target="_blank"><span class="redtext italicstext">v</span>HMML DH site</a> realize HMML's commitment to sharing its metadata with 
			researchers in the most user-friendly manner possible.
			</p>
			<h3 id="FUNDING" class="subheading jumptarget">Funding</h3>
			<span class="redtext italicstext">v</span>HMML relies on the generous support of institutional and individual donors. 
			Funding for <span class="redtext italicstext">v</span>HMML 1.0 came from a National Leadership Grant awarded by the 
			<a href="https://www.imls.gov/" target="_blank">Institute of Museum and Library Services</a>, a federal agency. 
			The project received significant contributed funding and services from Saint Louis University and the University of 
			Kentucky Research Foundation during the initial development phase. Further funding was provided by the <a href="http://www.arcadiafund.org.uk/" target="_blank">Arcadia Fund</a> of London and by generous individual donors. 
			<p>
				Creation of <span class="redtext italicstext">v</span>HMML 2.0 with Reading Room was made possible by a grant 
				from the Theology Program of the <a href="http://www.hluce.org/" target="_blank">Henry Luce Foundation</a>. The 
				development of the new metadata schema was supported by a grant from the Scholarly Communications Program of the <a href="https://mellon.org/" target="_blank">Andrew W. Mellon Foundation</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="redtext italicstext">v</span>HMML 3.0 was funded by a Digital Humanities Advancement Grant 
				from the <a href="https://www.neh.gov/" target="_blank">National Endowment for the Humanities</a>.
