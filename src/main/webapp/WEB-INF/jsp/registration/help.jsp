		<h3 id="ACCESSIBILITY" class="rrHelp jumptarget-breadcrumbs"> Universal Design</h3>
			<span class="redtext italicstext">v</span>HMML was envisioned, designed and created with principles of Universal Design in mind for all users, including those with different abilities. Accessibility for users who might utilize different input devices 
			or assistive technology was considered from the very beginning. Part of the goal was to try to make the interface more flexible to be accessible for all kinds of users, especially for <a href="${pageContext.request.contextPath}/readingRoom">Reading Room</a> and <a href="${pageContext.request.contextPath}/folio">Folio</a>. 
			We provided point of need context-sensitive Help on all modules, with <a href="${pageContext.request.contextPath}/contact">contact email</a> available from any page from a contact link in the footer. <a href="http://www.hmml.org/" target="_blank">HMML</a> realizes that accessibility and Universal Design are goals 
			in which we can continue to improve. Please <a href="${pageContext.request.contextPath}/contact">contact us</a> if you have issues accessing our <span class="redtext italicstext">v</span>HMML site or if you have ideas for how we might continue to improve our design so that all may participate in using our 
			resources and tools for manuscript studies.
