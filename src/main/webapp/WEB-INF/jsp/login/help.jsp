<h2><span class="redtext italicstext">v</span>HMML Sign In Help </h2>
	
<p>Many of the manuscripts in <span
				class="redtext italicstext">v</span>HMML <a href="${pageContext.request.contextPath}/readingRoom">Reading Room</a> are available for viewing only by registered users. 
				This is a requirement of the owning libraries so that readers are aware of certain rights reserved by those institutions. 
				Registration is <em>one-time</em> and <em>no-cost</em>. Once you have created an account and it has been confirmed by HMML, 
				you will be able to sign in and browse everything in Reading Room. 
	</p>
	<p>If you are <a href="${pageContext.request.contextPath}/login">signed in</a> to <span class="redtext italicstext">v</span>HMML and are not active on any of the pages for
 ${pageContext.session.maxInactiveInterval / 60  } minutes, the system will inquire whether you still want to remain signed in. If you still do not respond, the system will automatically sign you out to maintain security.</p>
<h3>Having trouble signing in?</h3>
<ul> 
	<li>Check to make sure that you are <a href="${pageContext.request.contextPath}/registration">registered</a>. </li>
	<li>Try closing your browser (quit) and then restarting it. </li>
	<li>Try to <a href="${pageContext.request.contextPath}/login">sign in</a> again.</li>
	<li>If you have forgotten your password, you can  <a href="${pageContext.request.contextPath}/user/forgotPassword">reset it</a>. 
	Please note that HMML staff are unable to reset your password for you nor can we see your password since it is encrypted.</li>
	
</ul>

<h3 id="ACCESSIBILITY" class="rrHelp jumptarget-breadcrumbs"> Universal Design</h3>
			<span class="redtext italicstext">v</span>HMML was envisioned, designed and created with principles of Universal Design in mind for all users, including those with different abilities. Accessibility for users who might utilize different input devices 
			or assistive technology was considered from the very beginning. Part of the goal was to try to make the interface more flexible to be accessible for all kinds of users, especially for <a href="${pageContext.request.contextPath}/readingRoom">Reading Room</a> and <a href="${pageContext.request.contextPath}/folio">Folio</a>. 
			We provided point of need context-sensitive Help on all modules, with <a href="${pageContext.request.contextPath}/contact">contact email</a> available from any page from a contact link in the footer. <a href="http://www.hmml.org/" target="_blank">HMML</a> realizes that accessibility and Universal Design are goals 
			in which we can continue to improve. Please <a href="${pageContext.request.contextPath}/contact">contact us</a> if you have issues accessing our <span class="redtext italicstext">v</span>HMML site or if you have ideas for how we might continue to improve our design so that all may participate in using our 
			resources and tools for manuscript studies.
